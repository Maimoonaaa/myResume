        <h1>Zero to One</h1>
        <p>Collaborated with a team to deliver my first formal pitch presentation at an entrepreneurship event organized by the E-Cell of IIT Guwahati. We selected a newly established startup and conducted in-depth research on its business model, market growth potential, branding strategies, marketing campaigns, and financial planning. Our analysis extended to evaluating the company’s future goals, scalability, and competitive edge. The objective was to build a compelling case for the startup’s legitimacy and viability, which we presented to a panel of peers and mentors. This experience honed my skills in market research, financial analysis, persuasive communication, and collaborative teamwork under a high-pressure, entrepreneurial environment.
