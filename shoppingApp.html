        <h1>Shopping app</h1>
        <p>Developed a fully functional shopping application using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, focusing on building a modern, responsive, and intuitive user interface. The project involved implementing core UI components such as LazyColumn, input fields, buttons, and various modifiers to ensure a dynamic and user-friendly experience. Leveraged Kotlin’s powerful features like lambda functions and mutable state handling to manage UI reactivity and navigation flow. In addition to front-end development, I also worked on integrating backend functionality to support user interaction and data management. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with Jetpack Compose’s declarative UI paradigm and deepened my understanding of Android development, UI architecture, and state management in modern mobile applications.
